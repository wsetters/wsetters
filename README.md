- Hi, I’m Spencer
- I’m interested in web/app development, AI, ML and meaningful projects that benefit the community
- I’m currently learning computer science at University of North Dakota
- I’m looking to collaborate on open source beginner friendly projects
- How to reach me: email me at etters98@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a paramedic, currently looking into web/app development or other careers in computer science to switch up my career path!

I am learning and trying to stay positive/successful in the face of this boom in technology/AI. Better to learn it than be scared of change!
